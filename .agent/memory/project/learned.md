## Hooks & Gates

- GitHub Issue #1274 (bug: require_docs.sh hook substring-matches any command containing gate keyword): This issue has been fixed. The `execution/hooks/require_docs.sh` script's `case` statement was updated from `"python3 "*"contract.py"*"gate"*)` to `"contract.py gate "*|"contract.py gate")` to enforce strict prefix matching. This ensures the hook only triggers for explicit `contract.py gate` commands. This fix has been implemented and verified by `test_require_docs_fix.sh`.
- (2026-06-18) The `maintainer -> close` handoff gate (`handoffs.yaml`) enforces `max_age_seconds: 86400` on `learned.md`. Any `git commit` from the maintainer agent is blocked by `require_maintainer.sh` unless `learned.md` has a `##` section, is ≥64 bytes, AND was modified within the last 24h. Fleet-loop / housekeeping commits must touch `learned.md` (even a dated note) to pass the close gate.

## Fleet-loop / Session Wrap

- (2026-06-18) Fleet-loop session: dismissed 157 deferred backlog noise items (check_own_comms pulse, qa-guard pings, quota-monitor alerts). Backlog compacted to 6 real open items — all Brad-blocked (D2/D4 payment, DNS, domain transfer) or athanor-upstream. No incoming CODI directive; standing autonomous directive confirmed.
